<h1>Introduction Cars</h1>
<p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods</p>

<h2>Type of Cars</h2>
<p>Like other vehicles, cars are made in different shapes and sizes, for people with different needs. Here are some common types of cars.</p>
    <p>- A convertible is a car with a roof that can be opened or taken off for an open-air drive. Sportier convertibles are called roadsters.</p>
    <p>- A hatchback is a smaller car with a cargo area that uses the same space as the cabin (instead of a separate trunk like in a sedan or coupes). 
        They combine the sportiness of coupes and sedans with the storage space of SUVs.</p>
    <p>- A pickup truck is a truck with a separate cabin and cargo area on a ladder frame. The cargo area is called the "bed".</p>
    <p>- A sedan is a car with a sloped rear window and separate trunk that has four doors.</p>
    <p>- An SUV (sport utility vehicle) is a rugged vehicle that has a combined passenger and cargo area (like in hatchbacks, station wagons, and vans). SUVs are very popular due to their usefulness.</p>
    <p>- A van is a big box-shaped vehicle meant for carrying plenty of passengers or cargo. There are many different sizes of vans, such as minivans, which are made for families.</p>

<h3>Advantage</h3>
<p>- Arrive quickly, rested, and neither too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>- Can travel any distance a lot faster than you can do so either on bike or on foot.</p>
<p>- Can listen to music or news while traveling without having to carry a radio along with you.</p>
<p>- When it rains, you can travel without getting wet.</p>

<h4>Disadvantage</h4>
<p>- Have a lot of money to buy it</p>
<p>- Change the windshield if it cracks</p>
<p>- Remember where you parked</p>
<p>- Keep up with the Services (oil, filter, brakes, belts,â€¦) and fix any mechanical failures not covered by warranty</p>
<p>- You might get a traffic/parking ticket</p>
